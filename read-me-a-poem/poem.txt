In the quiet of the night, a whispering breeze,
Carries tales of dreams with such gentle ease.
Stars above, like diamonds in the sky,
Glisten with secrets, as time drifts by.

The moon, a guardian in silver glow,
Watches over the world below.
In the stillness, hearts find peace,
Moments of calm, worries cease.

Whispers of leaves in a midnight dance,
Nature's lullaby, a sweet romance.
In dreams, we wander, free and light,
Guided by the stars, in the tranquil night.
